We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems. Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training.
